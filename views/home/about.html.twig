        <p class="lead">Moritake Industries rose from the bitter salt of two veteran pilots.</p>
        <p>Along with a starry-eyed new pilot, the trio set out on a quest to gain a foothold in New Eden. Soon enough, more pilots joined the ranks and what is now a thriving corporation began to take shape.</p>
        <p>Eventually, MOTKI began supplying tech 2 modules in factional warfare low-sec. But The Bleak Lands was far away from Jita headquarters. The company then laid plans to build a vast freeport in heart of FW low-sec space, serving as a tiny market hub for the desolate region.</p>

        <h2>A Freeport is opened</h2>
        <p>Moritake Industries is proud to provide free cloning, corporate offices, and repair to the busy faction warfare space. Freeport Lovich is also fitted with the latest in tech 2 component manufacturing, material efficiency research, and invention of all kinds.</p>
        <p>And what freeport is without a bustling market? MOTKI maintains a regular trade route between nearby market hubs to ensure the local community has all the gear necessary for great content-making.</p>
        <h2>Optimization</h2>
        <p>Early on, it was clear there was a great deal of potential in building software to help organize the average EVE corporation. An early proof-of-concept paved the way for a new generation of tools from human resources to production chain management. MOTKI has become a leader in custom software for all types of organizations.</p>
        <h2>Present and future</h2>
        <p>Moritake Industries remains a reliable provider of tech 2 modules and ships. Though the future is always mysterious and full of surprises, the team at MOTKI remains diligent.</p>
